> These dotfiles still work as I am writing this on February 17, 2026. Future updates could break one or more of the packages and I may or may not be active enough to fix it for you (please do contact me on **Discord** - **@nekorosys** - and I'll be happy to entertain any of your concerns). Worry not! For as long as I keep using Linux, it's suffice to say that this repo will be maintained for a very long time because it has always been intended to store a clean slate of my desktop environment. I do recommend fixing it yourself just in case it happens because it might help you learn more about maintaining your desktop experience!
