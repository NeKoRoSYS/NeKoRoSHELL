## CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are welcome!

Something's wrong with the repo or you know better workarounds and alternatives? You can fork the repo and make a pull request. It will be very much appreciated!

## Sponsorship
I am an aspiring software and game developer that currently do stuff solo. [Buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/nekorosys) is not a must, but it will be immensely cherished and appreciated! Editing code and files is not the only way you can contribute to the project :D
